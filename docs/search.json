    "text": "Questions\n\nHow many multiplications and additions do you need to perform a matrix multiplication between a (n, k) and (k, m) matrix? Explain.\nWrite Python code to multiply the above two matrices. Solve using list of lists and then use numpy. Compare the timing of both solutions. Which one is faster? Why?\nFinding the highest element in a list requires one pass of the array. Finding the second highest element requires 2 passes of the the array. Using this method, what is the time complexity of finding the median of the array? Can you suggest a better method? Can you implement both these methods in Python and compare against numpy.median routine in terms of time?\nWhat is the gradient of the following function with respect to x and y? \\[\nx^2y+y^3\\sin(x)\n\\]\nUse JAX to confirm the gradient evaluated by your method matches the analytical solution corresponding to a few random values of x and y\nUse sympy to confirm that you obtain the same gradient analytically.\nCreate a Python nested dictionary to represent hierarchical information. We want to store record of students and their marks. Something like:\n\n2022\n\nBranch 1\n\nRoll Number: 1, Name: N, Marks:\n\nMaths: 100, English: 70 …\n\n\nBranch 2\n\n2023\n\nBranch 1\nBranch 2\n\n2024\n\nBranch 1\nBranch 2\n\n2025\n\nBranch 1\nBranch 2\n\n\nStore the same information using Python classes. We have an overall database which is a list of year objects. Each year contains a list of branches. Each branch contains a list of students. Each student has some properties like name, roll number and has marks in some subjects.\nUsing matplotlib plot the following functions on the domain: x = 0.5 to 100.0 in steps of 0.5.\n\n\\(y = x\\)\n\\(y = x^2\\)\n\\(y = \\frac{x^3}{100}\\)\n\\(y = \\sin(x)\\)\n\\(y = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\)\n\\(y = \\log(x)\\)\n\\(y = e^x\\)\n\nUsing numpy generate a matrix of size 20X5 containing random numbers drawn uniformly from the range of 1 to 2. Using Pandas create a dataframe out of this matrix. Name the columns of the dataframe as “a”, “b”, “c”, “d”, “e”. Find the column with the highest standard deviation. Find the row with the lowest mean.\nAdd a new column to the dataframe called “f” which is the sum of the columns “a”, “b”, “c”, “d”, “e”. Create another column called “g”. The value in the column “g” should be “LT8” if the value in the column “f” is less than 8 and “GT8” otherwise. Find the number of rows in the dataframe where the value in the column “g” is “LT8”. Find the standard deviation of the column “f” for the rows where the value in the column “g” is “LT8” and “GT8” respectively.\nWrite a small piece of code to explain broadcasting in numpy.\nWrite a function to compute the argmin of a numpy array. The function should take a numpy array as input and return the index of the minimum element. You can use the np.argmin function to verify your solution."

    "text": "Quizzes\n\nWhat happens if I miss a quiz due to any reason?\n\nThe quiz will be marked as 0.\nThe provision of best 6 out of 8 quizzes is designed keeping in mind such scenarios.\n\nWill the quizzes and end-semester exam be open book? Will I be allowed to carry notes?\n\nNo, the exams and quizzes will be closed book. You are not permitted to carry notes.\n\nHow soon can I expect to receive my answer sheets back?\n\nYou should expect to receive answer sheets back in 4-5 working days.\n\nIs there an end-semester exam or mid-semester exam?\n\nNo, there is no end-semester exam or mid-semester exam. However, some of the quizzes may be held in the exam slot. In total we will have 8 equal weightage quizzes. The best 6 out of them will be considered for the final grade.\n\nWill the quizzes be MCQs or subjective?\n\nThe quizzes may contain both the MCQs and subjective questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\n\nWhat happens if I miss an assignment due to any reason?\n\nThere will no extensions for assignments.\n\nI have a doubt in the assignment. Whom should I write to?\n\nAsk on the slack General channel. If you don’t get a response within 2 days, write to the course instructor.\n\nI do not know Python. Can I code assignments in some other language?\n\nUnfortunately, no. You have to stick to Python.\n\nHow will you evaluate the assignment?\n\nThe assignments would be followed by a viva. The TAs would first check the code and compare against the submission. Any change from the submitted code is not allowed and any instance of the same would culminate in a warning. The TAs would run the code and ask a few questions. About 75% of these questions would be based on the assignment in question and about 25% would be based on the theory behind the concepts covered in the assignment.\nThe grade breakup would be: i) code runs correctly and solves the problem [50% marks]; ii) questions based on the assignment and student understanding of code [25% marks]; iii) code quality [12.5% marks]; iv) questions based on the theory behind the concepts covered in the assignments [12.5% marks]\n\nIs the assignment individual or group?\n\nThe assignment is TBA. In case of group, all team members get the same grade for the assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\n\nAttendance policy\n\nAttendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. Marks often correlated with attendance.\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\nIs there a project component in the course?\n\nNo. There is no project component in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus\n\nCan I choose a PR of my choice.\n\nYes, you can choose a PR of your choice from a list of PRs decided by the teaching staff. The teaching staff hold the right to decide whether a PR is suitable or not."
